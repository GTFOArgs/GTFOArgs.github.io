# GTFOArgs

Welcome to GTFOArgs, the go-to resource for finding Unix binaries that can be abused for argument injection.

Inspired by [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), GTFOArgs provides a curated list of programs and their associated arguments that can be exploited to gain privileged access or execute arbitrary commands on remote systems.

With easy-to-use search and filtering capabilities, GTFOArgs makes it simple to check whether a argument injection is applicable to a program, and find the right argument combination to suit your needs.
